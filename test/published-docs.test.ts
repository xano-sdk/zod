/**
 * The tarball contract: what `files` actually publishes, and whether the docs
 * inside it can be read once installed.
 *
 * A relative link in `llms.txt` or `README.md` is only meaningful to a consumer
 * if its target ships too — `node_modules/@xano-sdk/zod/` is the whole world for
 * an agent reading these files. `AGENTS.md` is for working on this repo and is
 * deliberately NOT shipped, so a shipped doc must not link to it relatively.
 *
 * The file list comes from `npm pack --dry-run --json` rather than from the
 * `files` array, so negations (`!dist/**\/*.map`), `.npmignore`, and npm's
 * always-included set are resolved by npm itself instead of re-implemented here.
